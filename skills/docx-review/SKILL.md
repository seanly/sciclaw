# docx-review

CLI tool for Word document review: tracked changes, comments, read, diff, and git integration. Built on Microsoft's Open XML SDK — 100% compatible tracked changes and comments.

## sciClaw-first rule

When operating inside sciClaw, prefer the typed tools for the common flows:

- `docx_review_read` for `--read --json`
- `docx_review_diff` for `--diff --json`
- `docx_review_apply` for manifest validation/apply flows

Use raw `docx-review` CLI only as fallback or for advanced modes the typed tools do not cover yet, such as `--textconv`, `--git-setup`, `--create`, `--template`, or unusual flag combinations.

## Install

```bash
brew tap drpedapati/tap
brew install sciclaw-docx-review
```

Binary: `/opt/homebrew/bin/docx-review` (12MB, self-contained, no runtime)

Verify: `docx-review --version`

## Workflow Choice (Critical)

### Creating a NEW manuscript/docx with clean output

Use `pandoc` from Markdown, not docx-review edit manifests:

```bash
pandoc manuscript.md -o manuscript.docx
```

sciClaw auto-applies its bundled NIH reference template for DOCX output unless `--reference-doc` is provided.

### Editing an EXISTING document with visible review markup

Use `docx-review` when tracked changes/comments are explicitly desired:

```bash
docx-review input.docx edits.json -o reviewed.docx --json
```

Inside sciClaw, the preferred mapping is:

- `docx_review_read` before planning edits
- `docx_review_apply` for `--dry-run --json` and the final apply step
- `docx_review_diff` for verification/comparison

### Anti-pattern to avoid

Do **not** use docx-review placeholder replacement manifests to create first-draft manuscripts. That workflow intentionally produces tracked changes and can make a fresh document appear as a markup-heavy revision file.

## Modes

### Edit: Apply tracked changes and comments

Takes a `.docx` + JSON manifest, produces a reviewed `.docx` with proper OOXML markup.

```bash
docx-review input.docx edits.json -o reviewed.docx
docx-review input.docx edits.json -o reviewed.docx --json    # structured output
docx-review input.docx edits.json --dry-run --json           # validate without modifying
cat edits.json | docx-review input.docx -o reviewed.docx     # stdin pipe
docx-review input.docx edits.json -o reviewed.docx --author "Dr. Smith"
```

### Read: Extract document content as JSON

```bash
docx-review input.docx --read --json
```

Returns: paragraphs (with styles), tracked changes (type/text/author/date), comments (anchor text/content/author), metadata (title/author/word count/revision), and summary statistics.

### Diff: Semantic comparison of two documents

```bash
docx-review --diff old.docx new.docx
docx-review --diff old.docx new.docx --json
```

Detects: text changes (word-level), formatting (bold/italic/font/color), comment modifications, tracked change differences, metadata changes, structural additions/removals.

### Git: Textconv driver for meaningful Word diffs

```bash
docx-review --textconv document.docx    # normalized text output
docx-review --git-setup                 # print .gitattributes/.gitconfig instructions
```

## JSON Manifest Format

This is the edit contract. Build this JSON, pass it to `docx-review`.

```json
{
  "author": "Reviewer Name",
  "changes": [
    { "type": "replace", "find": "exact text in document", "replace": "new text" },
    { "type": "delete", "find": "exact text to delete" },
    { "type": "insert_after", "anchor": "exact anchor text", "text": "text to insert after" },
    { "type": "insert_before", "anchor": "exact anchor text", "text": "text to insert before" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "anchor": "exact text to attach comment to", "text": "Comment content" }
  ]
}
```

### Change types

| Type | Fields | Result in Word |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `replace` | `find`, `replace` | Red strikethrough old + blue new text |
| `delete` | `find` | Red strikethrough |
| `insert_after` | `anchor`, `text` | Blue inserted text after anchor |
| `insert_before` | `anchor`, `text` | Blue inserted text before anchor |

### Critical rules for `find` and `anchor` text

1. **Must be exact copy-paste from the document.** The tool does ordinal string matching.
2. **Include enough context for uniqueness** — 15+ words when the phrase is common.
3. **First occurrence wins.** The tool replaces/anchors at the first match only.
4. Use `--dry-run --json` to validate all matches before applying.

## JSON Output (--json)

```json
{
  "input": "paper.docx",
  "output": "paper_reviewed.docx",
  "author": "Dr. Smith",
  "changes_attempted": 5,
  "changes_succeeded": 5,
  "comments_attempted": 3,
  "comments_succeeded": 3,
  "success": true,
  "results": [
    { "index": 0, "type": "comment", "success": true, "message": "Comment added" },
    { "index": 0, "type": "replace", "success": true, "message": "Replaced" }
  ]
}
```

Exit code 0 = all succeeded. Exit code 1 = at least one failed (partial success possible).

## Workflow: AI-Assisted Document Revision

Standard pattern for using docx-review with AI-generated edits:

### Step 1: Extract text

```bash
docx-review manuscript.docx --read --json > doc_content.json
```

Preferred inside sciClaw: `docx_review_read`

Or use pandoc for markdown extraction:

```bash
pandoc manuscript.docx -t markdown -o manuscript.md
```

### Step 2: Generate the manifest

Feed the extracted text + instructions to the AI. Request output as a docx-review JSON manifest.

Use this system context when prompting for manifest generation:

```
Generate a JSON edit manifest for docx-review. Output format:
{
  "author": "...",
  "changes": [{"type": "replace|delete|insert_after|insert_before", ...}],
  "comments": [{"anchor": "...", "text": "..."}]
}
CRITICAL: "find" and "anchor" values must be EXACT text from the document.
Include 15+ words of surrounding context for uniqueness. First match wins.
```

### Step 3: Validate with dry run

```bash
docx-review manuscript.docx manifest.json --dry-run --json
```

Preferred inside sciClaw: `docx_review_apply` in validation/dry-run mode

Check for failures. If any edits fail (`"success": false`), fix the manifest (usually the `find`/`anchor` text doesn't match exactly) and retry.

### Step 4: Apply

```bash
docx-review manuscript.docx manifest.json -o manuscript_reviewed.docx --json
```

Preferred inside sciClaw: `docx_review_apply`

### Step 5: Verify (optional)

```bash
docx-review manuscript_reviewed.docx --read --json | jq '.summary'
docx-review --diff manuscript.docx manuscript_reviewed.docx
```

Preferred inside sciClaw: `docx_review_read` and `docx_review_diff`

## Workflow: Peer Review Response

For addressing reviewer comments on a manuscript:

1. Extract manuscript text (`--read --json` or pandoc)
2. Build manifest addressing each reviewer point — use `replace` for text changes, `comments` to explain changes to the author
3. Dry-run validate
4. Apply edits
5. The output `.docx` has tracked changes the author can review in Word

## Workflow: Proofreading

1. Extract text
2. Generate manifest with grammar/style fixes as `replace` changes and suggestions as `comments`
3. Validate + apply
4. Author opens in Word, accepts/rejects each change individually

## Workflow: Template Population with Explicit Revision Trail (Advanced)

Only use this workflow when the user explicitly wants visible tracked changes during template population (for audit/review history):

1. Start from a template-backed `.docx`
2. Read it with `--read --json` to identify exact placeholders
3. Build a manifest that replaces placeholders with real content
4. Apply with `docx-review` (tracked insertions/deletions are expected)
5. Review and accept/reject changes in Word

For normal first-draft generation, use `pandoc manuscript.md -o manuscript.docx` instead.

## Key behaviors

- **Comments applied first**, then tracked changes. Ensures anchors resolve before XML is modified.
- **Formatting preserved.** RunProperties cloned from source runs onto both deleted and inserted text.
- **Multi-run text matching.** Text spanning multiple XML `<w:r>` elements (common in previously edited documents) is found and handled correctly.
- **Everything untouched is preserved.** Images, charts, bibliographies, footnotes, cross-references, styles, headers/footers survive intact.

## Companion tools

The Open XML SDK ecosystem:

| Tool | Install | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `pptx-review` | `brew install drpedapati/tools/pptx-review` | PowerPoint read/edit |
| `xlsx-review` | `brew install drpedapati/tools/xlsx-review` | Excel read/edit |

Same architecture: .NET 8, Open XML SDK, single binary, JSON in/out.
