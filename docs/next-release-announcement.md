# sciClaw v0.2.2 Announcement Copy

Keep the tone aligned with prior announcement files:
- short opening line
- concrete feature list
- problem/benefit framing
- one clear install/upgrade path
- no hype language that overclaims

Do not show real PHI, API keys, email addresses, bot tokens, or private channel names in screenshots.

## Tweet 1 - Main Release Announcement

sciClaw v0.2.2 is out.

This release makes private, local AI much easier to use without guesswork.

- the app now tells you whether your machine is actually a good fit for local mode
- routing sensitive rooms is clearer
- document workflows are safer and more guided

If you want the privacy of local AI without spending your day troubleshooting it, this release is for you.

## Tweet 2 - Local PHI Mode

You should not have to choose between “everything in the cloud” and “everything on one laptop.”

sciClaw now makes that split much clearer:
- keep a sensitive room local
- leave everything else on normal cloud defaults
- check in the app whether a machine is really ready for private local work

That is a better model than pretending every machine gives the same local AI experience.

---

## Tweet 3 - Honest Local Diagnostics

One of the hardest parts of local AI is not installation. It is figuring out whether it is actually usable on your machine.

sciClaw now tells you that more directly:
- whether local mode feels responsive or is just a slower backup
- when the last check ran
- what model is being used
- what failed if something is wrong

That matters a lot on CPU-only machines, where “supported” does not always mean “pleasant to use.”

---

## Tweet 4 - Safer Document Workflows

Working with documents should feel like using a product, not hoping the AI writes the right command.

sciClaw is moving more document tasks into built-in guided workflows, including PDF forms and Word review.

That means:
- fewer brittle command mistakes
- clearer results
- less operator babysitting

---

## Tweet 5 - Upgrade / Try It

If you already use sciClaw, update and open the app.

If you are new, install from Homebrew and do the rest from the sciClaw app in your terminal.

## Isolated Engagement Tweet 1 - Room-Level Local Routing

Hook:

You should be able to keep one room private without moving your entire setup to local mode.

Body:

That is the direction we are pushing in sciClaw:
- one sensitive room can stay local
- everything else can stay on normal defaults
- the app makes that easier to see and manage

Screenshot:
- Routing tab
- one mapped room highlighted
- detail pane visible with the runtime shown clearly
- synthetic channel name only

---

## Isolated Engagement Tweet 2 - CPU-Only Honesty

Hook:

Not every computer is a great local AI machine, and products should say that out loud.

Body:

sciClaw now does a better job of telling people the truth:
- some machines are good for everyday local work
- some are better as backup or occasional private use

That is a much better experience than vague “local supported” claims.

Screenshot:
- PHI tab on a CPU-only machine
- show `Suitability`, `Eval timings`, and `Last Output`

---

## Isolated Engagement Tweet 3 - Better Document UX

Hook:

People should not need to know command-line tricks just to review a Word file or fill a form safely.

Body:

We are slowly moving document work in that direction inside sciClaw:
- safer built-in workflows
- fewer fragile AI-generated commands
- more guidance inside the product itself

Screenshot:
- a clean app or terminal view with a successful document workflow
- optional before/after file names visible in a safe synthetic workspace

---

## Screenshot Guidance

### Best release screenshot

Use a side-by-side composite:
- left: PHI tab showing local suitability and eval timing
- right: Routing tab showing one room set to local

Why:
- communicates the main story in one image
- shows both machine readiness and room-level control

### Best second screenshot

Use a terminal + artifact pairing:
- one clean workflow result
- a visible output file or reviewed document next to it

Why:
- shows a real outcome without requiring technical detail

### Screenshot rules

- Use synthetic or public data only
- No real PHI
- No real Discord/Telegram private channel names
- No API keys or email addresses
- Prefer short workspace paths
- Keep `v0.2.2` visible in frame if possible

### Caption patterns that match prior style

- “sciClaw v0.2.2 is out.”
- “This release makes private, local AI much easier to use.”
- “You should not have to guess whether local mode is actually working.”
- “You should be able to keep one room private without moving everything local.”
- “Document workflows should feel guided, not fragile.”

### Phrases to avoid

- “game changer”
- “revolutionary”
- “perfect”
- “production-ready for every machine”
- “just works” unless the exact scope is narrow and defensible
